JS - Simple string reversal

You will be given a string and two indexes. Your task is to write logic to the function that will reverse the portion of that string between those two indices inclusive.

function solve(st,a,b){
 //.. YOUR LOGIC
}
Example
solve("developer",1,5) = "doleveper" -- elements at index 1 to 5 inclusive are "oleve". So we reverse them.
solve("dEVELOper", 1,5) = "dOLEVEper" -- to help visualize.
